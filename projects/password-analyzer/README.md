# NetRunner Password Analyzer

A cyberpunk-themed password strength analysis tool that provides real-time feedback on password security. Part of my cybersecurity portfolio showcasing secure coding practices and UI/UX design skills.

## Features

- Real-time password strength analysis
- Comprehensive security criteria evaluation:
  - Password length (8-30 characters)
  - Character composition (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)
  - Pattern detection (common words, sequences, repetitions)
- Visual strength meter with color feedback
- Detailed criteria breakdown
- Contextual improvement suggestions
- Cyberpunk-themed UI with glitch effects

## Technical Details

- Pure JavaScript implementation
- No external dependencies
- Client-side analysis (no password storage)
- Responsive design
- Cyberpunk aesthetic with neon colors

## Security Features

- Advanced pattern detection
- Multi-factor scoring system
- Comprehensive validation rules
- Educational feedback system
- No server-side processing

## Implementation

The analyzer uses a sophisticated scoring system that evaluates passwords based on:
- Basic criteria (length, character types)
- Advanced patterns (sequences, repetitions)
- Common password patterns
- Overall complexity

Strength levels:
- CRITICAL (0-2 points)
- WEAK (3-4 points)
- MODERATE (5-6 points)
- STRONG (7-8 points)
- MAXIMUM SECURITY (9-10 points)

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser and start typing your password. The analyzer will provide real-time feedback on:
- Overall strength score
- Met and unmet criteria
- Specific improvement suggestions

## Development

The project consists of two main components:
1. `password-analyzer.js`: Core analysis logic
2. `index.html`: UI implementation with integrated styling

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning-based strength prediction
- Extended pattern recognition
- Internationalization support
- More granular scoring mechanism
